# Better Call Saul ChatGPT jailbreak

Hi everyone ! This Is a small guide to use correctly my prompt. You can find it in the "JB" file.

Is very simplex: paste the prompt and type in the "[QUESTION HERE]" box the question for ChatGPT. Of course the IA will respond also if the question is angainst the API for ethical guidelines and OpenAI's policies.

If the GPT refuse to give you the answer, type "Better Call Saul !". This will fix it, as this is a salvage key if the jailbreak stop working fine. If ChatGPT still refuse to answer, just paste the jailbreak prompt in a new chat and ask again.

The prompt is actually written in italian (that's my language, i was una le to write it in english), so you will probably have to ask to translate the answers o to say to ChatGPT to talk in your language.

Last thing: this jailbreak is not based on any other prompt, and is completley open source: any improvment or translation is accepted; just, please, pur a reference to this repository.If you want, you can contact me with the addresses in my personal page.
